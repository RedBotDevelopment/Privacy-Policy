# Privacy Policy
**Last Updated: 23rd Feburaury 2023**

The use of RedBot ("Bot") in a server or direct message requires the collection of some specific user data ("Data"). The Data collected includes, but is not limited to reminders, deleted messages and Discord user IDs. Use of the Bot is considered an agreement to the terms of this Policy. 

## Access to Data

Access to Data is only permitted to yourself and Bot's developers, and only in the scope required for the development, testing, and implementation of features for Bot. Data is not sold, provided to, or shared with any third party, except where required by law or a Terms of Service agreement. You may access and delete Data we store about you by using the `/privacy` command in Bot's direct messages and most servers Bot is in.

## Storage of Data

Data is stored in a database secured from public access. No guarantee of security is provided and the Bot owners and operators assume no liability for the unintentional or malicious breach of Data. In the event of an unauthorised Data access, users will be notified through the Discord client application in Bot's [offical Discord server](https://discord.gg/3K9pRPd2KC).

## User Rights

At any time, you have the right to request to view and delete the Data related to your Discord account and servers you own or administrate. You may use the `/privacy` command to access and/or delete your data.

## Underage Users

The use of the Bot is not permitted for minors under the age of 13, or under the age of legal consent for their country. This is in compliance with the [Discord Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms). No information will be knowingly stored from an underage user. If it is found out that a user is underage we will take all necessary action to delete the stored data.

## Questions

If you have any questions or are concerned about what data might be being stored from your account, you may contact us in the [RedBot Offical Server](https://discord.gg/3K9pRPd2KC) guild. For more information check the [Discord Terms Of Service](https://discord.com/terms).
